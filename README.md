Promotions are an essential part of any business strategy. They help in increasing customer engagement and drive sales.

Coupon codes are a popular form of promotions that offer discounts to customers. However, creating and managing coupon codes can be a time-consuming and challenging task.

To address this issue, we have created a headless promotion engine that empowers merchants to generate both dynamic and static coupon codes while customizing all the attributes of the coupon code generation process.

Our promotion engine is flexible, scalable, and easily integrated into any web/app platform. Merchants can set specific rules and conditions for generating dynamic coupon codes and create bulk static coupon codes with the ability to set limits on usage, expiration dates, and customer eligibility.

# Features:
